Paragraphs Demo
The Paragraphs module in Drupal provides editors with a component driven architecture for building pages. Morpht has been developing Paragraph approaches to site building since 2015. This case study captures some of the content from a Drupal 7 "Paragraphs Demo" site which was built to showcase what could be done with Paragraphs.

Paragraphs give control back to content editors
The Paragraphs module allows content creators to choose which kinds of paragraphs they want to place on the page, and the order in which they want to place them. They can do all of this through the familiar node edit screen. There is no need to resort to code, the dreaded block placement config screen or Panelizer overrides. They just use node edit form where all content is available to them in one place.

Morpht has taken the Paragraph concept and run with it - building a number of supporting Drupal 7 modules giving Paragraphs more base functionality and site builders some easy wins with some Paragraph bundles ready to go.
